Store Sales and A/B Test Analysis


# Store Sales and A/B Test Analysis

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook walking through the data preparation, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, predictive modeling, and evaluation of results. Interactive visualizations are generated using Plotly and Bokeh.

The analysis compares performance metrics across three promotional strategies tested in a sample of restaurants over a four week period. Key techniques include ANOVA testing, linear regression, and time series forecasting.

Based on having the highest total sales and most consistent weekly growth, Promotion A is identified as the best performing strategy. The recommendation is to launch the new menu item nationwide using Promotion A.

Ongoing monitoring is advised to ensure continued positive performance once implemented. Adjustments to the promotional mix may be required based on the data insights.

This repository provides a template for a comprehensive A/B testing analysis covering the full process from data to visualization to modeling and recommendations. The documented methodology and interpreted results offer guidance for data-driven decision making.
